# 🔐 Proof-of-Existence Documentation

## Overview

The Proof-of-Existence feature allows users to create cryptographic proof that a file existed at a specific point in time by storing its hash on the blockchain. This is useful for:

- **Document timestamping**: Prove when a document was created
- **Intellectual property protection**: Establish creation dates for creative works
- **Data integrity verification**: Verify that files haven't been tampered with
- **Legal evidence**: Create tamper-proof timestamps for legal documents

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: User uploads a file through the web interface
2. **Hash Calculation**: System calculates SHA-256 hash of the file content
3. **Blockchain Storage**: Hash is stored in a new blockchain block with timestamp
4. **Automatic Mining**: Block is automatically mined and added to the chain
5. **Proof Generation**: System returns proof details including block hash and transaction ID

## Key Features

### ✅ **No Authentication Required**
- Unlike other blockchain operations, proof-of-existence doesn't require private keys
- Anyone can create proofs without registering as a user
- Simplified workflow for quick document verification

### ✅ **Automatic Block Creation**
- Each proof-of-existence creates a new block immediately
- No need to wait for mining by payment providers
- Instant proof generation and verification

### ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**
- System prevents duplicate proofs for the same file
- Each unique file hash can only be registered once
- Maintains blockchain integrity and prevents spam

### ✅ **Multiple Verification Methods**
- Verify by uploading the original file
- Verify by entering the file hash directly
- Browse all existing proofs
