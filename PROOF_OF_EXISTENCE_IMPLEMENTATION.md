## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Transaction Structure**
```javascript
{
  fromAddress: 'proof_of_existence_system',
  toAddress: 'proof_of_existence_system',
  amount: 0,
  type: 'proof_of_existence',
  fileHash: 'sha256_hash_of_file',
  fileName: 'original_filename.ext',
  timestamp: '2025-07-05T11:02:32.426Z'
}
```

### **Block Creation Flow**
1. User uploads file via web interface
2. System calculates SHA-256 hash of file content
3. Creates proof-of-existence transaction
4. Automatically creates and mines new block
5. Returns proof details to user
6. Block is added to blockchain permanently

### **Verification Flow**
1. User provides file or hash for verification
2. System calculates hash (if file provided)
3. Searches blockchain for matching hash
4. Returns verification result with original details
